# Add Observability

## Goal
Transform code into "Timeline Debugger". Expose internal behavior, data transformations, and state changes step-by-step.

## Non-Goal
- Raw execution logs without timeline context.

## When to Use
- Make internal state transitions visible for human understanding.

## When NOT to Use
- Request functional changes, bug fixes, or unit tests.

## Workflows
1. Identify opaque state changes.
2. Inject observability logs (e.g., `print`, structured logs).
3. Format traces as state transitions.
4. Output runnable code.

## Instructions
- **Log Explicitly**: Capture intermediate variables, loop iterations, branches, exceptions.
- **Visual Transitions**: Format output as timeline. Use separators, step numbers, labels (`[State A] -> (Transformation) -> [State B]`).
- **Distinct Traces**: Make added logs visually distinct from original output.

## Constraints
- NO logic alteration. Only add logs. Do not alter existing logic, return types, or algorithms.
